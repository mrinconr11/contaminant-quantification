This repository contains the an example of the Multilayer Perceptron and the Concolutional Neural Nerworks used in the publised paper "Application of machine learning methods for rapid fluorescence-based detection of naphthenic acids and phenol in natural surface waters"

The neural networks were used to take as input excitation emission matrices (EEMs) to predict nahpthenic acids and phenol concentrations.
