# contaminant-quantification
Convolutional neural network for image processing of an excitation-emission-matrix (EEM). The feature map extracted from the EEM is used to quantify napthenic acids and phenol's concentrations in natural water.

This code was used to get the results in the paper "Application of machine learning methods for rapid fluorescence-based detection of naphthenic acids and phenol in natural surface waters"
